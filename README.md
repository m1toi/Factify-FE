## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Factify is built with a separate backend and frontend. To run the application locally, you will need to have both servers running.

**This repository contains the Angular frontend.** The backend server has its own repository and setup instructions.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) (for the frontend)
-   A running instance of the [Factify Backend API](https://github.com/m1toi/Factify-BE) (see step 1)

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend Server

The backend is required for the frontend to function. It handles all business logic, database interactions, and user authentication.

1.  Go to the backend repository: **[Factify Backend Repository](https://github.com/m1toi/Factify-BE)**.
2.  Follow the setup and installation instructions provided in its `README.md` file.
3.  Once running, the backend API should be accessible, typically at `https://localhost:7091`.

### Step 2: Set Up the Frontend Application (This Repository)

Once the backend server is running, you can set up and start the Angular frontend.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/m1toi/Factify-FE.git  
cd Factify-FE/

# 2. Install the necessary npm packages
npm install

# 3. Start the Angular development server
ng serve
